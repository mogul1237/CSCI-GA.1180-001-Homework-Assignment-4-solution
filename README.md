m × n matrix with rank(A) = n, and b is nonzero.

Exercise 4.3. Let A be an m × n matrix with m > n and rank(A) = n. Assume that the singular value
decomposition of A is USV T
, where U is m × m and orthogonal, V is n × n and orthogonal, and S is an
m × n “diagonal” matrix of the form

,
where Sn is a nonsingular n × n diagonal matrix Sn = diag(σ1, . . . , σn), with σ1 ≥ · · · ≥ σn > 0.

combinations.

Exercise 4.4. Let A be an m × n matrix with m < n such that rank(A) = m. Assume that A can be written as A =  B S  , where B is nonsingular. (a) Given A in the form above, let Z be defined as Z = −B−1S In−m ! , where In−m is the (n − m) × (n − m) identity. Show that (i) AZ = 0 and that (ii) the columns of Z are linearly independent. (Which means that the columns of Z form a basis for the null space of A.) (b) When Z is defined as given above, describe how to form the matrix-products Zv and Z T q using only S and the LU factorization of B (so that the explicit matrix B−1 is not needed). 3 Exercise 4.5. This problem involves a variation on the (extremely silly) model discussed in class, developed by someone from another planet based on looking at pictures of smiling people in Vogue magazine. The underlying premise is that the happiest people seem to be tall, thin, and blonde. Assume that the visitor from another planet believes that happiness for a given individual is given by h ≈ x1 √ t − 4 + x2 100 w  + x3 exp(−c), (1) where t is “tallness” (measured in feet), w is weight (measured in pounds), c is hair color (where the measured value of c ranges from 0 to 1, with larger values meaning blonder hair), and h is happiness. The three coefficients x1, x2, and x3 are unknown. Suppose that you are given the following observed data for 6 people. ti 5.2 6.0 5.9 5.6 6.2 5.7 wi 240 162.3 130.8 150.1 95.9 141.2 ci 0.13 0.83 1.0 0.24 0.31 0.47 Assume that you wish to find the optimal coefficients x = (x1, x2, x3) T that produce the best fit of the model (1) to a given set of data by minimizing kb − Axk 2 2 for an appropriate matrix A and right-hand side vector b. If using Matlab for this problem, use format short e (and the equivalent in other systems). (a) Give the mathematical form of the entries in row i of A, expressed in terms of ti , wi , and ci . (b) Give the specific matrix A and the value of cond2(A). (c) Assume that the observed values of happiness for the six individuals are h = (9, 8, 7, 10, 12, 9). (i) Give the vector b that will appear in the least-squares problem, corresponding to the data above, and give kbk2. (ii) Solve the least-squares problem numerically, and state how you performed this calculation. Matlab will do this with the command x = A\b, or you may prefer to form and solve the normal equations explicitly. (iii) Give the optimal x, the vector Ax, the optimal residual vector r = b − Ax, krk2, and the ratio krk2/kbk2. (iv) Based on the numerical results, comment on whether the model seems to you to be effective at predicting the happiness of individuals in this group. Be explicit about how you measure effectiveness. (v) Which individual is predicted to be the happiest? Why (based on his/her individual properties) might this be the case? (vi) Which individual is predicted to be the least happy? Why (based on his/her individual properties) might this be the case? (vii) Which individual’s observed happiness is closest to the model’s prediction? Why (based on the individual’s properties) might this be the case? (viii) Which individual’s observed happiness is farthest from the model’s prediction? Why (based on the individual’s properties) might this be the case? (d) Assume that the happiness data were recorded incorrectly, and that the observed happiness values for the same six individuals should be h = (4.5, 6.5, 10, 5.5, 11, 6). 4 (i) Solve the least-squares problem numerically using the same A as in part (b), but with the second set of happiness data. Give the vector b for the second set of happiness data, the optimal x, the vector Ax, the optimal residual vector r = b − Ax, krk2, and the ratio krk2/kbk2. (ii) Is the model an effective predictor of happiness with this set of data? Explain your opinion using the numerical results. (iii) Does anything about the optimal coefficients in this case strike you as strange? If so, please explain and comment on possible causes, making an explicit comparison to the results in part (c).
